# Bottom-Navigation-Bar
Bottom Navigation Bar is used in many applications to make the application UI well-designed and effective. In this application, I create a Bottom Navigation Bar with fragments and one fragment contains a button which help to move from a fragment to activity.

First Screen when the user opens the application-

The user will be on Home Fragment (By default).

When the user clicks on move icon on the Bottom Navigation Bar, then the user will be on Move Fragment-

The Move Fragment contains a Button (MOVE Button) and when the user clicks on MOVE Button, the user will move to the Camera Activity-

If the user clicks on User icon on the Bottom Navigation Bar, then the user will be on User Fragment-

And if the user clicks on Camera icon, then the user will be on Camera Fragment-

Note that when the user was on move fragment and clicked on move button then the user moved to the camera activity and when the user clicks on camera icon, then the user comes on camera fragment.
One is fragment and one is activity.

Here, In this application, I have designed four fragments on the bottom navigation bar in a single activity. But user can also design any number of fragments in a single activity.
